The application may take a few moments to load!

A set of example files that can be used to experiment with the application's features are also provided and refer to the M7 open cluster. These example files 
include the magnitude coordinates files that can be used to acquire the magnitudes of the stars through GAIA, the photometric analysis of the cluster by PyMovie and
the extracted magnitudes of the stars.

In order for the application to operate the following libraries must be installed:

* Matplotlib
* numpy

For easier package management the installation of Python through Anaconda is recommended. This includes most of the required packages for the application
